# Introduction

Every developer knows the importance of a good Git workflow, but setting one up can be time-consuming and error-prone. That's why I created the Git Workflow Initializer - a set of scripts and configurations that automate the process of setting up a professional Git workflow for any project.

## The Problem

In my journey as a developer, I've seen (and been guilty of) inconsistent commit messages, manual version bumps, and forgotten changelog updates. These issues can lead to:

- Confusing commit histories
- Inconsistent versioning
- Time-consuming release processes
- Poor collaboration between team members

## The Solution

I built a solution to address project needs:

### Git Workflow Initializer
Perfect for small to medium projects, this setup includes:
- ✅ **Commit Message Validation** with commitlint
- 🔄 **Automated Versioning** using semantic-release
- 📜 **Automatic CHANGELOG** generation
- 🐶 **Git Hooks** with Husky
- 🔒 **GitHub Releases** integration

## Technical Implementation

The project leverages several powerful tools:

- **Husky**: For managing Git hooks
- **commitlint**: For commit message validation
- **semantic-release**: For automated versioning and changelog generation
- **release-it**: For release management
- **ESLint & Prettier**: For code quality and formatting

## Getting Started

I will show you how to set it up. I consider you already have a git repository. First you need to install the dependencies. Just grab the script and run it:

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arizmuajianisan/git-workflow-init/main/scripts/setup-git-simple.sh
chmod +x setup-git-simple.sh
./setup-git-simple.sh
```

After the installation completed, you need to add your github token to the .env file. You can get it from your github account.

You can start commiting your changes. The commit message will be validated by commitlint. If the commit message is not valid, it will not allow you to commit.

The rule for this commit is:

```bash
(type)(scope): subject -> Sentence case, imperative verb, no period at the end
```

## Example

Add new feature:

```bash
git commit -m "feat(user): Add login feature"
```

It will create a new version and update the changelog, i.e. `0.1.0` to `0.2.0`.

To add major change, you need to use the following format:

```bash
git commit -m "feat(user): Add login feature" -m "BREAKING CHANGE: Add login feature"
```

It will create a new version and update the changelog, i.e. `0.1.0` to `1.0.0`.

Example of invalid commit message:

```bash
git commit -m "feat(user): add login feature"
```

## Types

| **Type** | **Description**                                                                                             |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| build    | Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm)         |
| chore    | Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation              |
| ci       | Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: Travis, Circle, BrowserStack, SauceLabs) |
| docs     | Documentation changes                                                                                       |
| feat     | A new feature                                                                                               |
| fix      | A bug fix                                                                                                   |
| perf     | A code change that improves performance                                                                     |
| refactor | A code change that neither fixes a bug or adds a feature                                                    |
| style    | Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)      |
| test     | Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests                                                           |

## Sample Usage

<script src="https://asciinema.org/a/736131.js" id="asciicast-736131" async="true"></script>

## The Impact

Since implementing this workflow, I've noticed:
- More consistent commit messages
- Fewer versioning mistakes
- Automated changelog generation
- Improved code quality through automated checks
- Faster release cycles

## Conclusion

A good Git workflow shouldn't be an afterthought. By automating the mundane aspects of version control, we can focus on what really matters: writing great code. Whether you're working on a small personal project or a large enterprise application, having a consistent, automated workflow can save time and reduce errors.

I encourage you to try out the Git Workflow Initializer and let me know how it works for your projects!
