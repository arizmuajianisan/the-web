I have a habit I can‚Äôt fully control‚Äîone that automatically kicks in:¬†_multitasking_. For example, while working on Task A, certain parts of it remind me of Task B, instantly distracting me and shifting my focus to Task B. This can branch out further to Tasks C, D, and beyond. Right now, as I type this post, I‚Äôm technically juggling two different tasks. Then, a thought pops into my head:¬†_‚ÄúWhy am I working on these two things at once?‚Äù_¬†Oh, wait‚Äînow it‚Äôs three! All while I‚Äôm checking the terminal for an ongoing environment installation.

To most people, ‚Äúmultitasking‚Äù sounds impressive. How could it not? Someone who can handle multiple tasks at once must seem highly productive. But the reality is the opposite.

There‚Äôs already plenty written about multitasking, but I want to share my personal experience and efforts to reduce this automatic habit.

## **Multitasking: Less Productivity, More Problems**

Why does multitasking reduce productivity when logic suggests it should boost efficiency? The answer lies in the difference between the human brain and a machine‚Äôs processor. Our brains aren‚Äôt designed to handle multiple tasks simultaneously without distraction.

**Distraction**¬†is a unique trait of the human brain. We‚Äôre wired to focus on¬†**one thing at a time**.

So, is multitasking impossible? Of course not‚Äîbut not for tasks requiring full cognitive load. If you multitask while doing mentally demanding work, you‚Äôll likely face burnout. Your brain becomes exhausted, work progress slows, and deadlines slip.

Ironically, the original goal of multitasking‚Äîto boost productivity‚Äîbackfires.

## **The Right Approach: Single-Tasking**

There‚Äôs only one effective way to improve productivity:¬†**Focus on one thing at a time**.

Yes, we all know this answer. But why is it so hard to practice?

Distractions come not just externally (notifications, interruptions) but also¬†_internally_‚Äîour own wandering thoughts. To stay focused, we need consistency: the discipline to ignore sudden distractions and stick to the task at hand.

This requires training. For example, as I write this post, my brain urges me to check the environment installation progress or switch to another task. I consciously ignore those urges to finish this article. It sounds odd, but I know many people experience this too.

If I switched tasks to check the installation status, this post would likely end up abandoned in my drafts. Why? Because revisiting it later would feel less urgent‚Äîmy initial motivation would fade.

By staying focused on writing, I‚Äôve managed to complete this post faster.

# My Battle with Distractions

Actually, while writing this post, distractions flooded in: checking the installation, skipping disliked songs, glancing at phone notifications, and even shifting my sitting position.

Yet, focusing solely on this post proved that¬†**single-tasking works**. I finished it thoroughly and efficiently.

I am far away from keeping the mindset 'FOCUS', and learning about that is a never-ending process.

The best tool to keep our mind focused is also our mind, only ourselves that can maintain the focus.

# Conclusion

I wrote this post for myself‚Äîto prove that focusing on one task at a time helps me complete work faster. By dedicating our brain‚Äôs full resources to a single goal, we achieve better results.

If you‚Äôve felt the same struggle, I hope this resonates with you. Let‚Äôs train our brains to embrace depth over breadth.
