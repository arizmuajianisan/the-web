## Introduction

Storing documentation in traditional ways, such as using Microsoft Office and saving files on a NAS server, can be cumbersome and time-consuming. Finding specific documents often feels like looking for a needle in a haystack. To solve this issue, I experimented with various tools to create documentation for all the projects in my company, particularly for my team.

Eventually, I discovered **Vitepress**, a tool that makes creating and maintaining documentation easier. Since Markdown powers Vitepress, it seamlessly integrates with my existing documents in `.docx` format, requiring minimal changes.

> Because Vitepress uses Vue, it’s a natural fit for me. My familiarity with Vue from previous projects made Vitepress an obvious choice.

In this post, I’ll walk you through how to set up Vitepress to kickstart your own documentation site and explain why it could be the ideal tool for your projects.

## Installing Vitepress

Before installing Vitepress, ensure you have Node.js installed. I highly recommend using \*\*NVM\*\* (Node Version Manager) for easier management of Node.js versions.

To install Vitepress, follow these steps:

1\. Add Vitepress as a development dependency:

```bash
npm add -D vitepress
```

2\. Initialize a Vitepress project and answer a few setup questions:

```bash
npx vitepress init
```

Here’s a sample of how I answered the setup questions:


_Your answers may vary depending on your project requirements._

3\. Once setup is complete, run the following command to start your Vitepress project:

```bash
npm run docs:dev
```

4\. Access your documentation site at: `http://localhost:5173`.


## Customizing Vitepress

Now comes the exciting part: customizing your documentation site to fit your needs. Customization in Vitepress revolves around editing the \`config.js\` file, located at:

```bash
./docs/.vitepress/config.js
```

If you opted for TypeScript during initialization, the configuration file will have a \`.mts\` extension instead of \`.js\`.

Some key customization options include:

- Adding navigation menus
- Setting up a homepage
- Configuring a theme
- Implementing search functionality
- Enabling dark mode for better accesibility

Refer to the [official Vitepress documentation](https://vitepress.dev) for a comprehensive guide to all features.

In my case, I used Vitepress to deploy my internal documentation. The flexibility of Markdown and the lightweight nature of Vitepress made it an excellent choice.


## Conclusion

Using Vitepress gives you complete control over your documentation. It is especially suited for internal usage due to its simplicity and Markdown support, making documentation more concise and manageable. Its features, such as customizable themes, static site generation, and seamless integration with Vue, make it a reliable tool for any project.

I look forward to exploring Vitepress further and unlocking its full potential for our documentation needs. Whether you are an individual developer or part of a larger team, Vitepress can help you create a documentation site that is both user-friendly and efficient.
